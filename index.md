**Academic Honesty**:You are expected to uphold the Duke Community Standard. Any cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and will result in penalties ranging from a zero on the assignment to failing the course. Cheating includes, but is not limited to: using unauthorized materials during quizzes and exams; copying another student's solutions; copying from a solutions manual; copying a solution found on the internet; asking someone else to solve problems for you; or otherwise turning in work which is not your own. 

You may help each other on homework and labs, but the work you turn in must be your own. You must work alone during exams and quizzes.
